      <h8><p>Dolly&Sabby poultry is a family-focused operation currently in its third year of busy rearing  This operation was started in 2001, Our commitment to supplying the farming Industry with High Quality, High Performance, Disease Free stocks and treating our clients as extended family members is how we run our business today.
       We are one of the best suppliers of fully grwon chickens,eggs and chicks in South Africa, shipping close to 100,000 stocks annually.</p>
       <br>

      <p> With us,you’ll find answers to your farming- related questions. We believe we breed healthy chickens that conform to the South African Breeders’ Association (SABA) breed standards in all respects.
       One of our main objectives is to breed functionally efficient livestocks that can perform in the veld with the minimum of inputs. Absolute size and weight (“fatness”) are not the alpha and omega for us,
     productivity under low-cost conditions are. Fertility, hardiness, and mothering abilities are key factors in the success of our stud and we aim to deliver these traits to our clients.</p>
     <br>
     Our animal health program is rigorously managed and implemented and the condition of our livestock and Poultry reflects this.
    <p>Our mission is to improve the health and performance of people, chicknens, and plants through nutrition and scientific innovation. We pursue this mission guided by what we call the ACE principle, our promise that in doing business we have a positive impact on the livestocks, the Consumer, and the Environment</p>

    <p>We sell fertile hatching eggs. All you need to do is place them in an egg incubator and see them hatch!
    The quality of the hatching eggs are excellent and we have recorded up to 98% hatch rates in our Sure-hatch Egg incubators using these fertile broiler eggs.</p></h8>

    <p>Our chicks are vaccinated at day old against New Castle Disease and Infectious Bronchitis.
    All our chicks have immediate access to feed and water after hatch to ensure that they are strong and hydrated before transport to their new owners.
    All our chicks are handled with  the utmost care, respect and dignity.</p>
